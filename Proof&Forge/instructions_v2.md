Create a modern Web3 landing page where a 3D cartoon Bitcoin character acts as a persistent animated guide that slowly moves as the user scrolls, transitioning smoothly from the hero section into the next sections. The motion must feel elegant, slow, premium, and integrated with the storytelling of the page.

🎯 CORE IDEA


Design a single-page website layout where:



• A 3D Bitcoin mascot appears in the hero section

• As the user scrolls down, the character slowly moves with the page

• The character transitions between sections

• Each section slightly changes the pose or motion

• Movement is subtle, continuous, and cinematic



This should feel like the character is guiding the user through the product.

🪙 CHARACTER DESCRIPTION (must remain consistent)


Use the same 3D character across all sections:



• Golden Bitcoin coin body

• Embossed ₿ symbol

• Small arms and legs

• White gloves

• Friendly expressive eyes

• Clean sneakers

• Smooth metallic gold material

• Soft reflections



Personality:



• calm

• friendly

• confident

• intelligent



No exaggerated cartoon behavior.

🎨 HERO SECTION (START POSITION)


Layout:



• Character placed slightly right of center

• Floating gently in place

• Soft idle animation:

very slow breathing motion

tiny hand movement

subtle body sway



Background:



• Soft white → light gold gradient

• Floating minimal crypto particles



Action:



• Character slowly waves once

• Small glow pulse from the ₿ symbol



This is the initial state before scroll.

📜 SCROLL-TRIGGERED MOVEMENT SYSTEM


The character must move based on scroll position.



Motion rules:



• Movement must be slow and smooth

• No jumps

• No fast transitions

• Use continuous interpolation between sections

• Keep the character always visible



As the user scrolls:



• Character gently drifts downward

• Slight horizontal parallax shift

• Slight rotation changes



Feels like:



The mascot is traveling through the story.

🧭 SECTION-BY-SECTION CHARACTER BEHAVIOR


SECTION 1 → HERO


Pose:



• Standing

• Slight floating

• Friendly wave



Position:



• Right side of screen

SECTION 2 → “Create Skill Proof”


As scroll begins:



• Character slowly moves downward with scroll

• Slightly rotates body toward center

• Stops near middle-right of screen



New action:



• Pulls out a glowing stylus

• Draws a floating digital signature in the air



Animation must be subtle and loopable.

SECTION 3 → “Badge Creation”


As user scrolls more:



• Character continues drifting down

• Moves slightly left (parallax shift)

• A glowing badge appears near hands



Pose change:



• Character holds the badge

• Looks proud

• Small glow pulse behind badge

SECTION 4 → “Verification / Trust Section”


Motion:



• Character settles lower on the page

• Stops moving vertically



Pose:



• Arms crossed confidently

• Gentle idle breathing



Environment:



• Floating small hex particles around

SECTION 5 → FINAL SECTION / CTA


Final motion:



• Character slowly drifts to center

• Turns slightly toward viewer



Final pose:



• Thumbs up

• Soft light burst behind



Then returns to subtle idle loop.

🎬 ANIMATION PHYSICS


All motion must be:



• slow

• soft

• floating

• cinematic



Use:



• smooth easing

• parallax effect

• scroll interpolation



Avoid:



• sudden jumps

• fast spins

• exaggerated cartoon motion

📐 TECHNICAL LAYOUT BEHAVIOR


Character should:



• Be layered above background but below main text

• Maintain consistent size

• Scale slightly smaller as it moves downward

• Move relative to scroll depth



Movement should feel tied to scroll progress.

💡 DEPTH & PARALLAX EFFECT


Add depth:



• Background elements move slower

• Character moves slightly faster

• UI cards fade in as character reaches each section



This creates:



• 3D storytelling effect

• Visual continuity

🌟 LIGHTING CONSISTENCY


Keep lighting identical across sections:



• Soft studio lighting

• Warm gold reflections

• Gentle rim light



So the character always looks like the same entity.

🧠 EXPERIENCE GOAL


The user should feel like:



• The mascot is guiding them

• The site is alive

• The scroll is a journey



Not distracting — just immersive.

🎭 MOOD


The final feeling must be:



• premium Web3 startup

• futuristic but clean

• playful but professional



Like a product demo from a funded crypto company.

⚙️ FINAL OUTPUT TARGET


Generate:



• A full scroll-driven landing page layout

• Persistent animated 3D mascot

• Smooth transitions between sections

• Character repositioning based on scroll



The character must feel integrated into the UI, not just placed on top.
